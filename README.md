## Features

### Run Retros Remotely
Postfacto lets you run an agile retrospective even when your team is distributed across the world. Retros live update across all your devices
so each participant can follow along on their device

### Record Action Items
Retros are designed to help the team improve and that's hard to do without keeping track of the actions the team needs to carry 
out and the also the one's you've achieved. Postfacto tracks the items you enter week to week to help you keep on top of them.

### Mobile Friendly
Participants can add and vote on items from their mobile devices, so its easy to run a retro without everyone in the group having a laptop nearby. This works really well for retros where some people 
are in the room and some are remote

### Easy Onboarding
Easily [set up](https://github.com/pivotal/postfacto/tree/master/deployment#allowing-users-to-create-retros) Postfacto to work with Google OAuth so users can sign up with their google accounts
